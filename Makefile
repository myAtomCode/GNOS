# GNU coreutils 9.9 — the other half of what makes a shell prompt feel like a

#
#   --enable-no-install-program=stdbuf drops libstdbuf.so.  It is the only
#   shared object coreutils builds, and musl-gcc's static-only setup cannot
#   produce one (`relocation R_X86_64_32 can not be used when making a shared
#   object`).  stdbuf is useless here anyway: it works by LD_PRELOAD.
#
#   HELP2MAN=: MAKEINFO=: because the man pages are generated by *running* each
#   freshly built binary with --help, and the texinfo manual needs makeinfo.
#   Neither ships in the image, so both are stubbed out to `true`.

#
# Two more hand edits live in the tree and must be re-applied after any
# re-configure:
#   - the libtool script in each subdirectory swallows `-static` as one of
#     its own mode flags and never passes it to the compiler driver, so the
#     tools come out dynamically linked against libc and die instantly on
#     this kernel (no ld-musl).  The `-static | -static-libtool-libs)`
#     branch in func_mode_link is patched to append " -static" to the
#     compile/finalize commands instead of `continue`.
#   - `disable-shared` in configure makes the bfd/opcodes/ctf libraries
#     static archives, otherwise libtool links the executables against
#     uninstalled .so files.

#   musl's <stdint.h>, <stddef.h> and <syscall.h> -- plain -I beats -isystem.

# nothing that includes it.  That is not merely a stale-build annoyance here:
# proc.h defines proc_t, and half the kernel indexes into it, so a field added
# to that struct and recompiled into only one object gives two translation
# units two different memory layouts.  The result is a kernel that links
# cleanly and then corrupts user processes -- which is exactly how the last
# `-MMD`-less afternoon was spent.  -MP adds a phony target per header so a
# deleted or renamed header does not wedge make with "no rule to make target".
