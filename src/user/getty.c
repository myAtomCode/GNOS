/*
 * getty.c — open a terminal, greet whoever is at it, and hand it to login.
 * (GPLv2)
 *
 * One of these runs on each of the six virtual terminals.  Its job is to turn
 * a bare character device into a *session*:
 *
 *   setsid()      leave init's session, become a session leader with no
 *                 controlling terminal -- the precondition for the next step;
 *   TIOCSCTTY     claim /dev/ttyN as this session's controlling terminal, so
 *                 that Ctrl-C on it reaches the right process group and
 *                 /dev/tty resolves to it for everything downstream;
 *   tcsetpgrp()   make ourselves (and therefore login, and the shell it
 *                 execs) the foreground job.
 *
 * Skip any of that and the shell starts without job control: Ctrl-C kills
 * nothing, and every background process that touches the terminal gets a
 * SIGTTOU it never asked for.
 *
 * Usage: getty ttyN [login-program]
