/*
 * init.c — GNOS init, PID 1. (GPLv2)
 *
 * init is a supervisor, not a terminal.  It does exactly three things:
 *
 *   - makes itself immune to the terminal's signals, so that a stray Ctrl-C
 *     can never take the whole system down,
 *   - runs /etc/rc once, then starts a getty on each of the six virtual
 *     terminals, each in a session of its own,
 *   - reaps children forever, including the orphans the kernel re-parents
 *     onto it, and restarts whichever getty died.
 *
 * The getty layer is what makes this a multi-user system rather than a
 * single-user one with credentials bolted on.  init runs as root and must
 * stay that way -- it is the only process that can start a session -- so the
 * privilege drop has to happen somewhere downstream, and "somewhere" is
 * login(1), one exec later.  Each terminal therefore runs:
 *
 *     init (root) -> getty (root, owns /dev/ttyN) -> login (root, then not)
 *                 -> the user's shell
 *
 * Keeping each of those in a process of its own is not decoration: job
 * control is defined in terms of process groups and a controlling terminal,
 * and a session that never called setsid() has neither.
