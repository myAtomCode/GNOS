 *
 * The parsing rules are Linux's, from fs/binfmt_script.c, and the details
 * matter for compatibility:
 *
 *   - only the first 256 bytes are examined, and a line longer than that with
 *     no newline in it is not a script at all;
 *   - everything after the interpreter path is ONE argument, not a word list.
 *     "#!/bin/sh -eu" passes the single string "-eu"; it does not pass "-e"
 *     and "-u".  Splitting it would break every script that relies on the
 *     single-argument rule, which is most of the ones that use it;
 *   - the original argv[0] is discarded and replaced by the interpreter, and
 *     the script's own path is spliced in as the interpreter's first file
 *     argument.
 *
 * The path we splice in is the already-normalised absolute one rather than
 * the string the caller passed, so the interpreter can still find the script
 * if it happens to chdir() before opening it.
