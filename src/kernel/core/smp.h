/*
 * smp.h — SMP support for GNOS. (GPLv2)
 *
 * Two-stage: smp_init() brings the APs online through Limine, and each AP
 * then joins the shared EEVDF scheduler from ap_main().  The per-CPU state
 * -- the current process, the kernel stack the ring-3 entry paths switch
 * to, and the idle context's park point -- lives in the first slots of
 * struct cpu, whose address every core keeps in GS.  The offsets of the
 * two slots isr.asm touches are fixed and documented below; they are part
 * of the C/asm ABI.
 *
 * Locking: the run queue and the process table are guarded by a spinlock
 * (g_proc_lock, private to proc.c).  Everything else the kernel shares is
 * serialised by the big kernel lock, so the rest of the tree stays
 * lock-free exactly as it was on one core.
