/*
 * tmpfs.h — an in-memory filesystem for the mount(2) syscall. (GPLv2)
 *
 * This is the only filesystem type our mount() supports: OpenRC and friends
 * want to put tmpfs on /run, /tmp, /dev/shm and the like, and that is exactly
 * what a RAM-backed tree of directories and files provides.  It is deliberately
 * small: no hard links, no real permissions enforcement, no mmap — just enough
 * that a boot script can mkdir /run/lock, write a state file, and read it back.
 *
 * Storage is a fixed static node pool plus a fixed static data arena, so the
 * filesystem needs no kernel allocator and can never fragment.  Unlinked file
 * data is leaked (not reclaimed) — acceptable for a toy kernel where tmpfs
 * lives only for the lifetime of one boot.
