/*
 * kernel.c — GNOS 64-bit kernel (GNOSKr.elf), booted by Limine. (GPLv2)
 *
 * Limine enters kernel_entry() in long mode with paging already enabled:
 *   - the whole of physical RAM is direct-mapped at the HHDM offset
 *     (limine_hhdm_response.offset, normally 0xFFFF800000000000),
 *   - the kernel image itself lives at 0xFFFFFFFF80000000.
 * Every pointer Limine hands us (framebuffer address, module address, the
 * response structs themselves) is therefore an *already mapped* higher-half
 * virtual address -- we can dereference it straight away and must NOT try to
 * turn it back into a physical address.
 *
 * Bring-up order, and why:
 *   1. GDT/TSS and IDT first, so that from here on a bad memory access is a
 *      readable panic instead of a silent triple fault.
 *   2. Console, so the panic has somewhere to appear.
 *   3. PMM and VMM, because every later step allocates memory.
 *   4. VFS over the initrd, then the tty on top of it.
 *   5. The syscall gate and the timer.
 *   6. PID 1, built from /init.elf, and then the scheduler -- which never
 *      returns: this function becomes the idle loop.
